    <p>
      *Some things are better whispered than shouted.  
      Some stories are stitched in silence, in the space between ink and velvet.*
    </p>

    <p>
      Ink & Velvet was never meant to be loud.  
      It was born from a girl who loved the night more than the morning, who felt deeply but spoke softly — a girl who didn’t just dream, but built those dreams with her own hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      This space is a reflection of her world: a little bit dark, a little bit magic.  
      Here, we collect fragments — of poetry, of feelings, of unfinished thoughts — and turn them into something soft but powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every piece you’ll find here holds a part of that story.  
      The journals, the digital creations, the quiet moments turned into something tangible — they're made for the ones who feel too much. The ones who glow differently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ink & Velvet isn’t just a shop.  
      It’s a sanctuary for girls who want to lead, create, and heal — without changing who they are.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’re not too quiet. You’re not too much. You’re exactly right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Welcome to a place that finally feels like yours.
